FlashLearn provides a simple interface and orchestration **(up to 1000 calls/min)** for incorporating **Agent LLMs** into your typical workflows and ETL pipelines. Conduct data transformations, classifications, summarizations, rewriting, and custom multi-step tasks, just like you’d do with any standard ML library, harnessing the power of LLMs under the hood. Each **step and task has a compact JSON definition** which makes pipelines simple to understand and maintain. It supports **LiteLLM**, **Ollama**, **OpenAI**, **DeepSeek**, and all other OpenAI-compatible clients.

## Learning a New “Skill”

Like a fit/predict pattern, you can quickly “learn” a custom skill. Below, we’ll create a skill that evaluates the likelihood of buying a product from user comments on social media posts, returning a score (1–100) and a short reason. We’ll instruct the LLM to transform each comment according to our custom specifications.

```python
from flashlearn.skills.learn_skill import LearnSkill
from openai import OpenAI

# Instantiate your pipeline “estimator” or “transformer”
learner = LearnSkill(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", client=OpenAI())
# Provide instructions and sample data for the new skill
skill = learner.learn_skill(
    df=[], #dif you want you can also pass data sample
    task=(
        "Evaluate how likely the user is to buy my product based on the sentiment in their comment, "
        "return an integer 1-100 on key 'likely_to_buy', "
        "and a short explanation on key 'reason'."
    ),
)

# Save skill to be used from any system
skill.save("evaluate_buy_comments_skill.json")

```

---

## Input Is a List of Dictionaries

Whether you retrieved data from an API, a spreadsheet, or user-submitted forms, you can simply wrap each record into a dictionary. FlashLearn’s “skills” accept a list of such dictionaries, as shown below:

```python
user_inputs = [
    {"comment_text": "I love this product, it's everything I wanted!"},
    {"comment_text": "Not impressed... wouldn't consider buying this."},
    # ...
]
```

---

## Run in 3 Lines of Code

Once you’ve defined or learned a skill, you can load it as though it were a specialized transformer in a standard ML pipeline. Then apply it to your data in just a few lines:

```python
from flashlearn.skills.general_skill import GeneralSkill

with open("evaluate_buy_comments_skill.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    definition= json.load(file)

# Suppose we previously saved a learned skill to "evaluate_buy_comments_skill.json".
skill = GeneralSkill.load_skill(definition)

tasks = skill.create_tasks(user_inputs)
results = skill.run_tasks_in_parallel(tasks)
print(results)
```

---

## Get Structured Results

FlashLearn returns structured outputs for each of your records. The keys in the results dictionary map to the indexes of your original list. For example:

```json
{
  "0": {
    "likely_to_buy": 90,
    "reason": "Comment shows strong enthusiasm and positive sentiment."
  },
  "1": {
    "likely_to_buy": 25,
    "reason": "Expressed disappointment and reluctance to purchase."
  }
}
```

---

## Pass on to Next Steps

Each record’s output can then be used in downstream tasks. For instance, you might:

1. Store the results in a database  
2. Filter for high-likelihood leads  
3. Send them to another tool for further analysis (for example, rewriting the “reason” in a formal tone)

Below is a small example showing how you might parse the dictionary and feed it into a separate function:

```python
# Suppose 'flash_results' is the dictionary with structured LLM outputs
for idx, result in flash_results.items():
    desired_score = result["likely_to_buy"]
    reason_text = result["reason"]
    # Now do something with the score and reason, e.g., store in DB or pass to next step
    print(f"Comment #{idx} => Score: {desired_score}, Reason: {reason_text}")
```
## Supported LLM Providers
Anywhere you might rely on an ML pipeline component, you can swap in an LLM:

```python
client = OpenAI()  # This is equivalent to instantiating a pipeline component 
deep_seek = OpenAI(api_key='YOUR DEEPSEEK API KEY', base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")
lite_llm = FlashLiteLLMClient()  # LiteLLM integration Manages keys as environment variables, akin to a top-level pipeline manager
ollama =  OpenAI(base_url = 'http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama', # required, but unused) # Just use ollama's openai client
```

# Customization

## “All JSON, All the Time”: Example Classification Workflow

The following example classifies IMDB movie reviews into “positive” or “negative” sentiment. Notice how at each step you can view, store, or chain the partial results—always in JSON format.

```python
from flashlearn.utils import imdb_reviews_50k
from flashlearn.skills import GeneralSkill
from flashlearn.skills.toolkit import ClassifyReviewSentiment
import json
import os


def main():
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "API-KEY"

  # Step 1: Load or generate your data
  data = imdb_reviews_50k(sample=100)  # 100 sample reviews

  # Step 2: Load JSON definition of skill in dict format
  skill = GeneralSkill.load_skill(ClassifyReviewSentiment)

  # Step 3: Save skill definition in JSON for later loading
  # skill.save("BinaryClassificationSkill.json")

  # Step 5: Convert data rows into JSON tasks
  tasks = skill.create_tasks(data)

  # Step 6: Save results to a JSONL file and run now or later
  with open('tasks.jsonl', 'w') as jsonl_file:
    for entry in tasks:
      jsonl_file.write(json.dumps(entry) + '\n')

  # Step 7: Run tasks (in parallel by default)
  results = skill.run_tasks_in_parallel(tasks)

  # Step 8: Every output is strict JSON
  # You can easily map results back to inputs
  # e.g., store results as JSON Lines
  with open('sentiment_results.jsonl', 'w') as f:
    for task_id, output in results.items():
      input_json = data[int(task_id)]
      input_json['result'] = output
      f.write(json.dumps(input_json) + '\n')

  # Step 9: Inspect or chain the JSON results
  print("Sample result:", results.get("0"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

The output is consistently keyed by task ID (`"0"`, `"1"`, etc.), with the JSON content that your pipeline can parse or store with no guesswork.

## “Skill” Is Just a Simple Dictionary

Internally, a skill is just a compact JSON-like object containing instructions and, optionally, function definitions to strictly validate LLM outputs. You can generate this skill from sample data (as shown above) or create it directly:

```python
EvaluateToBuySkill = {
  "skill_class": "GeneralSkill",
  "system_prompt": "Evaluate how likely the user is to buy our product, returning an integer 1-100 and a short reason.",
  "function_definition": {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "EvaluateToBuySkill",
      "description": "Assess user text with respect to willingness to buy a certain product.",
      "strict": True,
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "likely_to_buy": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "A number from 1 to 100 indicating how likely the user is to buy."
          },
          "reason": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A brief explanation of why this is the likely score."
          }
        },
        "required": ["likely_to_buy", "reason"],
        "additionalProperties": False
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can load or save this skill to JSON as needed, version it, share it, or plug it into your pipelines. FlashLearn makes the entire process—training, storing, loading, and using such custom LLM transformations—simple and uniform.

## Single-Step Classification Using Prebuilt Skills
Classic classification tasks are as straightforward as calling “fit_predict” on a ML estimator:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from flashlearn.skills.classification import ClassificationSkill

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
data = [{"message": "Where is my refund?"}, {"message": "My product was damaged!"}]

skill = ClassificationSkill(
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    client=OpenAI(),
    categories=["billing","product issue"],
    system_prompt="Classify the request."
)

tasks = skill.create_tasks(data)
print(skill.run_tasks_in_parallel(tasks))
```

## **Parallel Execution**: 

`run_tasks_in_parallel` organizes concurrent requests to the LLM.

## **Cost Estimation**
Quickly preview your token usage:
  ```python
  cost_estimate = skill.estimate_tasks_cost(tasks)
  print("Estimated cost:", cost_estimate)
  ```

## Loading a Skill

Here’s how the library handles comedic rewrites:

```python
from flashlearn.skills import GeneralSkill
from flashlearn.skills.toolkit import HumorizeText


def main():
  data = [{"original_text": "We are behind schedule."}]
  skill = GeneralSkill.load_skill(HumorizeText)
  tasks = skill.create_tasks(data)
  results = skill.run_tasks_in_parallel(tasks)
  print(results)
```

You’ll see output like:
```json
{
  "0": {
    "comedic_version": "Hilarious take on your sentence..."
  }
}
```
Everything is well-structured JSON, suitable for further analysis.
